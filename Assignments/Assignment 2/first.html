	<h1>Nepal</h1>
 <h2>Nepal, the landlocked multiethnic, multilingual, multi-religious country, is situated north of India in the Himalayas, in the region where, about 40 to 50 million years ago, the Indian subcontinent crashed into Asia. Because of that accident, Nepal has some of the world's highest mountains, including Sagarmatha (Mt. Everest, 8848m, which it shares with Tibet
   (by now a province of China). The highest mountain on Earth is towering above populated valleys and forested plains.</h2>
<h3>Nepal can be divided broadly into three ecological zones: the lowland, the midland and the highland.
  The altitude of the Himalayan region (the highlands) ranges from 4877 m - 8848 m; it includes 8 of the highest 14 peaks in the world that exceed heights of 8000 meters, including Mount Everest.
  The Lower Himalayan region accounts for about 64 percent of total land area, which is formed by the Mahabharat range that soars up to 4877 m and the lower Churia range (Sivalik Hills).
  The lowland Terai, the flat river plain of the Ganges with a belt of marshy grasslands, savannas, and forests, occupies about 17 percent of the country's total land area.
</h3>
<h4>Tourism is one of the largest and fastest-growing industries in Nepal, employing more than a million people and contributing 7.9% of the total GDP.[209] The number of international visitors crossed one million in 2018 for the first time (not counting Indian tourists arriving by land).[209][210] Nepal's share of visitors to South Asia is about 6%, and they spend much less on average, with Nepal sharing 1.7% of the earnings.[211] Premier destinations include Pokhara, the Annapurna trekking circuit and the four UNESCO world heritage sitesâ€”Lumbini, Sagarmatha National Park (home to Mount Everest), seven sites in the Kathmandu Valley collectively listed as one, and Chitwan National Park. Most of Nepal's mountaineering earning comes from Mount Everest, which is more accessible from the Nepalese side.

<h5>The rate of unemployment and underemployment exceeds half of the working-age population,[213] driving millions to seek employment abroad, mainly in India, the Gulf, and East Asia. Mostly unskilled, uneducated, and indebted to loan sharks, these workers are swindled by the manpower companies and sent to exploitative employers or war-ridden countries under fraudulent contracts.[214][215] They have their passports seized, to be returned when the employer grants them leave or terminates their contracts. Most do not get paid minimum wage,[216] and many are forced to forfeit all or part of the wages.[217] Many Nepalis work in extremely unsafe conditions; an average of two workers die each day.[218] Due to restrictions placed on women, many depend on traffickers to get out of the country, and end up victims of violence and abuse.[219] Many Nepalese are believed to be working under slavery-like conditions, and Nepal spends billions of rupees rescuing stranded workers, on remuneration to the indebted families of the dead, and in legal costs for those arrested in foreign countries.[220][221] Though millions have raised themselves out of 
  poverty, due to a lack of entrepreneurial skills, the remittance is largely spent on real estate and consumption.[222][221]</h5>
